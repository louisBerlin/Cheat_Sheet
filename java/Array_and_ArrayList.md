## The `for-each` Loop
The `for-each` loop is a simplified version of the `for` loop and makes it easier to iterate over arrays. It is used when we want to iterate over all elements in an array without using the index.

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

The `for-each` loop is particularly useful when we don't need direct access to the index and simply want to access each element in the array.
