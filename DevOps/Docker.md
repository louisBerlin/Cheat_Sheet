### Containers and Images  
___ 

- **Container**: A container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. Within the container, the application runs isolated from the environment.
- **Images**: An image is a self-contained and executable software package that contains everything needed to run an application. It includes the code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and settings.

> ðŸ’¡ Images are read-only and are used to create containers.
